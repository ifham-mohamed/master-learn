# SD07 — Data model

Week 5 · Core · Warehouse checkpoint B05


## Review and learn

Entities, relationships, lifecycle states and ownership.

## Do the work

Model a warehouse, SKU, balance, shipment, shipment lines, reservation and event history.

## Pass check

Walk through create, reserve, cancel and dispatch and reconcile both quantities and transitions.

## Further architecture practice

- 1. Establish service boundaries · after B14. A boundary test catches a forbidden dependency. The last-unit and rollback tests still pass. State which data is authoritative and how you would roll back a split.
- 3. Extract a Tracking microservice · after B20. Take Tracking down while dispatch continues. Restart it and rebuild a clean projection from the retained event archive. Reconcile results. Run API contract tests, deploy Tracking independently, and rehearse routing traffic back to the original tracking view.



## Record one entry

Use your [learning log](notes/journal.md) for what you learned, what you tried and observed, and your next step. Put shared project code in `projects/warehouse-dispatch/`. Create `code/` for an isolated experiment or `results/` for a separate output file only when you have something to keep.
